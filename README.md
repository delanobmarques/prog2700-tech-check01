# PROG 2700 - Tech Check 1

### JavaScript Fundamentals

**Value:** 7.5% of overall course mark  
**Time to complete:** 1 hour

### PhoneWords

Create a JavaScript application that will convert a _PhoneWord_ or Vanity Number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword) to a set of numbers. An example would be taking 1-800-HOLIDAY and getting 18004654329.

The image below shows the keypad you will be emulating:

**Note:** in North America, the alphabet begins with the number 2 on the keypad. You have been provided with starter code in this repository (index.html and main.js). The code that you are asked to write should go in the function indicated called _convertPhoneWord_. The script will execute a _testCode()_ function that will test your code. Errors will be written to the console until your code is sufficient implemented. **Do not write any code outside of the area indicated.**

#### Requirements

Given any PhoneWord:

- Ignore any non -alphanumeric characters: (), -, etc.
- Keep any existing digits
- Resolve a letter to a number according to the keypad image
- Complete the _convertPhoneWord_ function such that all tests pass.

#### Submission Instructions

Once your program is complete, commit and push with a message "Ready for Marking".
